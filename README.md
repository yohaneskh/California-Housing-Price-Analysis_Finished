# California_Housing_Price_Analysis_Finished

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict housing prices in California, using structured tabular data. The project includes **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, **model training**, **hyperparameter tuning**, **interpretation with SHAP**, and **model evaluation**.

---

## A. Objective
To develop a robust regression machine learning model that accurately predicts the median house value based on various features such as **location**, **income**, **population**, and **proximity to the ocean**.

---

## B. Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle `(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices)`.
- **Target Variable**: `median_house_value`.
